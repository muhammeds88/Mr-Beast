His early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers".He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.
